This is the SSE-C compiler.  A C-like language with features for
parallel computation with SIMD registers.  This is language is not
meant for writing full programs, it is meant for writing inner
subroutines for high-performance computing programs.

This program is written in pure python to make development fast.
Modern machines are so fast that compile speed hopefully won't be a
problem.
